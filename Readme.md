This is a tutorial for how you can add Watson’s cognitive service to an Android app in under 10 minutes. The voice user interface is a great way to enhance the user interface of IoT devices, robots, or a voice-controlled vehicle. IBM Watson Text-To-Speech service is available from the IBM Bluemix catalog.

Note: If you haven’t done so already, please skim my prior post “Connect native Android app to Watson Sentiment Analysis in under 10 minutes” since it covers steps in more detail than in this post.

Prerequisites:-
1. Download the Android Studio and install it
2. You’ll need either a real Android device (a smartphone or a tablet), or a virtual one (emulator)
3. Signup for IBM Bluemix to get access to IBM Watson cognitive services.
4. Overview of steps

Below is an overview of the steps:
1. Create a typical Android application in Java
2. Add the Watson lib: Watson-Developer-Cloud SDK for Java
3. Instantiate the Bluemix Watson service and get the key token to it
4. Add some code in your Android app to invoke the cognitive service
5. Quick test of the app.

You’ll build a simple application with a submit button, an editable text field, and an output field. The video below shows the steps:
